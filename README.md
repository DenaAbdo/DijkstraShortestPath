# DijkstraShortestPath
This project implements Dijkstra's algorithm to calculate the shortest distance between two countries. The algorithm finds the shortest path in a weighted graph, which is represented by countries and the distances between them.

### Features
- Calculate the shortest distance between two selected countries.
- Display the path taken by the algorithm on a map.

### Known Issues
- Map Image Quality: The current image used for the map is not of high quality, which may affect the user experience.
- Path Display Issue: After the first input, the line displaying the path does not update correctly for subsequent inputs. This is a known bug and will be addressed in future updates.

### Future Improvements
- Enhanced UI: Improve the quality of the map image to provide a better visual experience.
- Bug Fix: Fix the issue where the path line does not update after the first input.
